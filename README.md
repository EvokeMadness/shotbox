A photography light box I built and use that fits a [16" x 12" project tray](https://www.michaels.com/finger-paint-tray-by-creatology/M20010634.html).

Will add pictures soon!

I built this to stream toy and Lego content to [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/evokemadness). It's the second iteration of this design, improving on the fit around a project tray I purchased from Michaels.
